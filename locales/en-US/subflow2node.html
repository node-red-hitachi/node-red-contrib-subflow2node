    <h3>Details</h3>
    <p>By default this node converts an input subflow definition
    installable binary NPM package.  If `Output base64 encoded NPM
    package` is checked, output is conveted to base64 encoded string.</p>

    <p>This node also support encodeing of exported subflow definition.
    AES encoding is supported by default. When installing AES encoded
    package, decoding key must be assigned to OS environment variable <code>NR_FLOW_DECODE_KEY</code>. </p>

    <p>Note: This node expects SUBFLOW definition exported from subflow template.  Also, generated NPM package may not work for subflow definitions with nested subflow.</p>
